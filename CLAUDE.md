# Wad Evoker — Project Context

A Python + PyQt6 desktop WAD library manager and launcher for classic Doom (1993).
Dark, terminal-aesthetic UI. Linux-native, but cross-platform via PyQt6 (Windows/macOS compatible).

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Always update this file after completing tasks — document fixes, new features, and architectural changes in the appropriate sections below.

---

## Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **GUI**: PyQt6
- **Database**: SQLite via Python's built-in `sqlite3`
- **Config**: `configparser` — INI file at `~/.config/wad-evoker/config.ini`
- **WAD parsing**: `omgifol` 0.5.1 — lump access + Doom graphic decoding (`to_Image("RGBA")`)
- **Image handling**: `Pillow` — RGBA conversion and PNG cache writes

## Data Storage

All user data lives under `~/.config/wad-evoker/`:

| Path         | Purpose                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `library.db` | SQLite database                                                       |
| `wads/`      | Imported WAD/PK3 files (copied here on import)                        |

## Key Behaviours

### Import flow

1. User clicks **＋ Add WAD** or drops a file onto the window
2. `wad_importer.import_file(path)` is called
3. If `.zip`: extracted to a temp dir, all `.wad`/`.pk3` files inside are found
4. Each WAD is copied to `~/.config/wad-evoker/wads/` (deduplicated with `_1`, `_2` suffixes)
5. A `.txt` sidecar file in the same directory is parsed for metadata
6. `db.add_wad(...)` is called — silently skips if filepath already exists (UNIQUE constraint)
7. Library list and Recent bar are refreshed

### .txt parser (`wad_importer.parse_txt`)

- Parses idgames-archive-format `.txt` files (key `:` value lines)
- Field map: `title`, `author`, `description`, `year`, `game`, `number of levels / map count / levels released → map_count`
- After copy, `maplist.extract_maps(dest)` is called and the result stored as `map_list` (newline-separated string)
- Falls back to `title_from_filename()` (underscore/dash → spaces, title-cased) if no title found
- Continuation lines (indented or non-key lines after a key) are appended to the previous value

### Launch flow

1. User selects a WAD and clicks **▶ LAUNCH**
2. `sourceport.launch_wad(filepath)` is called
3. Runs: `subprocess.Popen([binary, "-file", wad_filepath])`
4. On success: `db.update_last_played(wad_id)` is called, Recent bar refreshes
5. On failure: `QMessageBox.warning` shown with the error

### Edit metadata flow

1. User selects a WAD and clicks **✎ EDIT** (left of the Launch button)
2. `WadDetailPanel` emits `edit_requested(wad_id)`
3. `MainWindow._on_edit` opens `WadEditDialog(wad_id)`
4. On **Save**, `db.update_wad(...)` updates the editable columns in the `wads` table
5. Library list is refreshed and the detail panel re-renders the updated WAD
6. If `titlepic_path` or `map_list` are cleared, the app re-extracts them from the WAD on disk

### Source port config

- Stored in `~/.config/wad-evoker/config.ini` under `[sourceport] binary = /path/to/binary`
- Changeable at runtime via **⚙ Settings** — no restart needed
- Settings dialog validates path live: checks `os.path.isfile` + `os.access(X_OK)`
- Currently single binary — designed for easy extension to named profiles

### Tags

- Stored in `tags` table, linked by `wad_id`
- UI: chip-style widgets with × remove button, plus a text input to add new tags
- `TagsWidget` emits `tags_changed(list)` signal; `MainWindow` diffs against DB and syncs

### Search

- `db.search_wads(query)` does a LIKE match across `wads.title`, `wads.author`, and `tags.tag`
- Live — fires on every keystroke via `QLineEdit.textChanged`

---

## UI / Styling

- **Aesthetic**: Dark terminal / Doom-flavored. Blood red (`#cc2200`) accents, near-black backgrounds, `Courier New` monospace throughout
- **All styles are inline QSS** (Qt StyleSheets) applied per-widget via `setStyleSheet()`
- No external style files or asset dependencies
- Key color tokens (not extracted to variables yet — good first refactor):
  - Background: `#141414`, `#111`, `#0d0d0d`
  - Accent: `#cc2200`, `#8b0000`, `#ff4422`
  - Text: `#e8e0d0`, `#ccc`, `#666`
  - Border: `#2a2a2a`, `#3a3a3a`

## What's Implemented (PoC)

- [x] Import `.wad`, `.pk3`, `.zip`
- [x] Drag & drop onto window
- [x] `.txt` sidecar metadata parsing
- [x] SQLite library with full CRUD
- [x] Tag chips (add / remove)
- [x] Last Played / Recent bar
- [x] Configurable source port binary (Settings dialog)
- [x] Launch with `-file` param passed to binary
- [x] Search (title, author, tags)
- [x] Delete from library (file on disk preserved)
- [x] **TITLEPIC extraction** — `titlepic.py` extracts via `omgifol` for `.wad`; for `.pk3` tries direct PNG/JPG, raw Doom graphic lump, then embedded `.wad`. Cached as PNG under `titlepics/`. Displayed as background on Recent cards and alongside metadata in the detail panel. Lazy extraction on first select for pre-existing library entries.
- [x] **Map list display** — `maplist.py` uses `omgifol` to enumerate all map marker lumps (`MAP##` / `E#M#`) from the WAD. If a `MAPINFO`, `ZMAPINFO`, or `UMAPINFO` lump is present, it is parsed to produce `MAP01: Level Name` formatted lines; otherwise plain map names are used. The result is stored as a newline-separated `map_list` TEXT column in the DB. In the detail panel a `MapListWidget` (full-width scrollable `QTextEdit`, max 200 px tall) is rendered below the Description section and is hidden automatically when no map data is available. Lazy extraction runs on WAD select for pre-existing library entries (mirrors titlepic pattern).
- [x] **Edit WAD dialog** — `WadEditDialog` allows editing title/author/year/game/description, changing the WAD file path (with a Browse picker), and editing `map_list`. Game uses a fixed dropdown (Doom/Doom 2/TNT/Plutonia). Includes a collapsible side-by-side sidecar `.txt` preview with a manual file picker; preview decoding auto-detects common encodings (notably CP437/CP1252).

## Planned Known bugs to fix / UI/UX to be fixed

- [x] When deleting a WAD entry, the user does not have the choice to hard-delete the .wad, so the .wad is still present in the disk even though there's no entry in the list
- [ ] Currently, when importing a WAD, the sidecar .txt does not gets imported. It's just added to the database but the file get's separated from the .wad when it should be available. This causes an issue when editing the WAD that causes the .txt panel to never have the necessary info for the user
- [x] CRITICAL: Sometimes when a wad is drag-n-dropped, instead of displaying the correct metadata for the wad, it displays data from a random wad. Looks like cache'd data but i'm not sure where it's coming from. Right now it appears as Wasted 2: The Crusher with the description: The second in an occassional series of small but tough-ish levels. From the metadata, TITLEPIC is ok, Filename is ok but the rest of the metadata contains the seeminly cache data
- [x] Auto-updater should be more visible. Right now, if the user get's prompted to update and it clicks "Yes", the only feedback the user has is a "Downloading Update" message at the bottom. It should display a full window with a progress bar displaying the update download's progress. Once that's done, it should restart.

## Planned / Nice-to-Haves (not yet implemented)

- [ ] **Muti-wad + DEH Support** - Some maps contains multiple wads and a DeHackEd file to improve experience. The idea is for the app to know they're part of a single entry and load them together when launching the entry.
- [x] **Auto-update** — `updater.py` checks `https://api.github.com/repos/exequiel-mleziva/wad-evoker/releases/latest` on boot (2 s delay, background `QThread`). If a newer tag exists, user is prompted to install; download replaces app files in-place and `os.execv` restarts. Settings dialog exposes a **Check for Updates** button with inline status feedback and an **Update Now** button.
- [ ] **Multiple named source port profiles** — e.g. "UZDoom", "DSDA", "Crispy" selectable per-launch or as default
- [ ] **Time played tracking** — store `play_duration_seconds` in `wads` table; hook into process monitoring via `subprocess` + `time`
- [ ] **Screenshot support** — store screenshot paths, display in detail panel
- [ ] **Stats** — similar to DoomLauncher (https://github.com/nstlaurent/DoomLauncher): kills, deaths, secrets per session
- [ ] **IWAD selection** — let user specify the base IWAD (`doom2.wad`, `doom.wad`, etc.) passed via `-iwad`
- [ ] **Extra args per WAD** — store and pass custom launch args (e.g. `-skill 4 -warp 1`)
- [ ] **Sort / filter** — sort library by title, date added, last played; filter by tag
- [ ] **Packaging** — `pyproject.toml`, `.desktop` file for Linux app launcher integration, optional PyInstaller bundle
- [x] Add maplist display, with support for MAPINFO to get the maps names (if available, if not just display the maps that are modified in the custom wad)

## Known Bugs & Fixes

### MAPINFO `lookup` keyword (fixed)

ZDoom-format MAPINFO files use `map MAP01 lookup "HUSTR_1"` to reference names from the `LANGUAGE` lump. The original quoted-name regex (`map (\w+) "([^"]+)"`) did not account for the `lookup` keyword, so those lines were never matched. The unquoted fallback then matched them and captured the literal word `lookup` as the display name — causing every map to appear as `"lookup"` in the UI.

**Fix** (`maplist.py` → `_parse_mapinfo_text`):
- Quoted regex updated to `map (\w+) (?:lookup )?"([^"]+)"` — now captures the quoted key regardless of whether `lookup` is present.
- Unquoted fallback guards against `name.lower() == "lookup"` to prevent the word leaking through if somehow reached.

**Library migration note**:
- Older DB entries may have stored `map_list` lines where every map name was literally `lookup`. On WAD selection, `MainWindow._on_wad_selected` now refreshes the stored `map_list` if it is empty or contains the substring `lookup`.

### Detail panel — MAPS meta row & map list layout (fixed)

The left metadata column had a redundant `MAPS` row (showing `—`) alongside a 180 px-wide `MapListWidget` squeezed between the metadata and the TITLEPIC image. Map names with long titles were truncated and unreadable.

**Fix** (`ui/wad_detail.py`):
- Removed the `MAPS` meta row from `_build_ui` and its corresponding assignment in `show_wad`.
- Removed `setFixedWidth(180)` from `MapListWidget` so it stretches to full panel width.
- Moved `MapListWidget` out of the `meta_and_pic` `QHBoxLayout` and into the main `detail_layout` directly below the Description section.
- Increased `MapListWidget` max height from 125 → 200 px.

### Delete WAD — hard-delete option (fixed)

When deleting a WAD entry, users could only remove it from the library database — the `.wad`/`.pk3` file remained on disk with no option to delete it. This caused orphaned files to accumulate in `~/.config/wad-evoker/wads/`.

**Fix** (`ui/main_window.py` → `MainWindow._on_delete`):
- Replaced simple Yes/No confirmation with a 3-option dialog:
  - **Cancel** — abort the operation
  - **Remove from Library** — delete DB entry only (original behavior)
  - **Remove + Delete File** — delete DB entry and also delete the file from disk
- **Safety guard**: Hard-delete is only allowed if the WAD's `filepath` is inside the app-managed library folder (`wad_importer.WAD_DIR`). Uses `os.path.commonpath()` to verify the file is a child of the managed directory.
- If the user requests hard-delete but the file is outside the managed folder, a warning dialog is shown and the operation falls back to library-only removal.
- Error handling: If `os.remove()` fails (permissions, file in use, etc.), a warning dialog is shown with the error message. The DB entry is still removed.
- Status bar feedback differentiates between "WAD removed from library" and "WAD removed and file deleted."

### Auto-updater progress feedback (fixed)

When users accepted an update, the only feedback was a "Downloading Update" message in the status bar. There was no visual indication of download progress or installation status, making it unclear whether the update was working or stalled.

**Fix** (`updater.py` + `ui/update_progress_dialog.py` + `ui/main_window.py`):
- Created `UpdateProgressDialog` — a modal dialog with progress bar, status label, and download size display
- Modified `UpdateDownloadWorker` to emit `progress(downloaded, total)` and `status_changed(message)` signals during download
- Download now reads in chunks (8KB) and reports progress after each chunk
- Progress bar shows percentage and MB downloaded/total
- Status messages update through phases: "Downloading update...", "Extracting update...", "Installing update...", "Update complete! Restarting..."
- Dialog uses indeterminate progress mode during extraction/installation phases
- Styled to match the app's dark terminal aesthetic with blood-red progress bar gradient
- On failure, dialog closes and error is shown via `QMessageBox`

### Stale metadata on drag-and-drop import (fixed)

When a WAD was drag-and-dropped and imported, the detail panel would sometimes display metadata from a previously selected WAD instead of the newly imported one. The TITLEPIC and filename were correct, but title, author, description, and other fields showed cached data from another WAD in the library.

**Root causes**:
1. **Incorrect .txt sidecar fallback** (`wad_importer.py` → `_find_and_parse_txt`):
   - When no matching `.txt` file was found for a WAD, the function had a fallback that grabbed **any** `.txt` file in the same directory
   - This caused WADs without sidecars to inherit metadata from unrelated `.txt` files (e.g., other WADs' sidecars in the same import folder)
   - Result: WADs imported with completely wrong metadata from random `.txt` files

2. **Stale cached data in list widget** (`ui/main_window.py`):
   - `WadListWidget.populate()` stores WAD data in `Qt.ItemDataRole.UserRole` for each list item
   - When `refresh_library()` was called after import, the list was cleared and rebuilt
   - During this rebuild, Qt's selection mechanism could trigger `currentItemChanged` with stale WAD data
   - `_on_wad_selected` received this cached dict and displayed it without verifying against the database
   - The newly imported WAD's ID was never explicitly selected, so the wrong WAD's data persisted in the detail panel

**Fix** (`wad_importer.py` → `_find_and_parse_txt`):
- Removed the fallback loop that grabbed any `.txt` file in the directory
- Now only parses `.txt` files that match the WAD filename (e.g., `mymap.txt` for `mymap.wad`)
- WADs without matching sidecars import with minimal metadata (filename-derived title only), allowing users to fill in details manually

**Fix** (`ui/main_window.py` → `_import_path` and `_on_wad_selected`):
- Track `last_imported_id` during the import loop to identify the most recently imported WAD
- Call `detail_panel.clear()` before `refresh_library()` to prevent stale data from being displayed during the refresh
- After refresh, explicitly select the newly imported WAD by calling `wad_list.select_wad_by_id(last_imported_id)`
- Modified `_on_wad_selected` to **always fetch fresh data from the database** using `db.get_wad_by_id(wad_id)` instead of trusting the cached dict passed from the list widget
- This ensures the detail panel always displays current, accurate metadata regardless of list widget state

---

## Running

```bash
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` handles full environment setup automatically:

1. Checks for `.venv/bin/activate` — if missing, creates the virtual environment via `python3 -m venv`
2. If venv creation fails (e.g. `ensurepip` not available), detects the Python version and runs `sudo apt-get install -y python3.X-venv` on apt-based systems (Debian/Ubuntu/Kubuntu), then retries
3. On non-apt systems, prints a clear error and exits
4. Activates the venv, upgrades `pip`, installs `requirements.txt`, then launches `main.py`

Must be run from inside the `wad-evoker/` directory so Python resolves the `ui` package correctly.
